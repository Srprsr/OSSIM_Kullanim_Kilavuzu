# OSSIM_Kullanim Kılavuzu
OSSIM – Meaning Open Source Security Information Manager. The goal of OSSIM is to fill a gap in the needs of security professionals. 
Considering the important technological advances of recent years that have made tools with capacities
such as those of IDS available, it is surprising that it is so complex from a security standpoint to
obtain a snapshot of a network as well as information with a level of abstraction that allows practical
and manageable monitoring.
